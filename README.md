# IntroSDE-Assignement1
First assignement for the course IntroSDE 2015

##Execution
To execute the code, please run in your terminal: 
	```bash
    ant compile
    ant execute.HPWriter
    ```
This was a requirement of the assignement, so i choosed to make the execute.evaluation depend to the download of ivy, dependencies and compiling of the code. 
This allows to simply type the command in a terminal to make it work.
It assumes Java and Apache ANt are already installed and working on the machine.
