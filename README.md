# IntroSDE-Assignement1 : Matteo Grossele
First assignement for the course IntroSDE 2015

##Code Structure

##Problems Solved
The assignement had different task to complete :
* Use xpath to implement methods like getWeight and getHeight of a given person

##Execution
To execute the code, please run in your terminal: 
	```
    	ant execute.evaluation
    ```.
    
This was a requirement of the assignement, so i choosed to make the execute.evaluation depend to the download of ivy, dependencies and compiling of the code; allowing to simply type the command in a terminal to make it work.
It assumes Java and Apache Ant are already installed and working on the machine.
